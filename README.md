### Description

Sorry to everyone for re-uploading this as "new"...somehow the old .zip got lost in the moderation.

Anyway, for those who don't know - these tutorials cover all aspects of per-pixel interfacing in VB. Included in the tutorial are sections on Point/PSet, Get/SetPixel/V, Get/SetBitmapBits, and Get/StretchDIBits. Speed comparisons and an extra page on general graphics optimizations is included. The tutorials have been completely reformatted and updated with a new section on 4-bit alignment in DIB section width, as well as information on SafeArrays and graphics programming. Comments are welcome!
