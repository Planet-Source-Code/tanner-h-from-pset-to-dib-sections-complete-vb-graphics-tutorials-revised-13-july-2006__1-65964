      <td valign="top" width="80%">
      
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Visual Basic CAN do fast graphics - I promise</span></font></p>

      
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To my fellow Visual Basic users:</font></p>

      
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In my experience, many VB
programmers seem to believe that fast graphics programming is
impossible in VB. &nbsp;Most complain that PSet and Point (or GetPixel
and SetPixel) just aren't fast enough for their needs, and they feel
like they have to switch to an alternate language for any serious
graphics-related coding.</font></p>

      
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is most definitely not the case, and I hope - by the end of these tutorials - to have you feeling quite differently.</font></p>

      
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Using some
creativity and efficient coding you can use Visual Basic to do almost
anything that
C++, java,&nbsp;DirectX or OpenGL does - and almost always as
fast&nbsp;(and in some cases faster!). &nbsp;The code for DIB
sections,&nbsp;the ultimate end of these tutorials, is not
well-documented anywhere
else on the net, so I have set out to clearly explain how fast
graphics-related code can be used inside Visual Basic without a lot of
extra work or overly-cryptic API calls.</font></p>

      
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Also, unlike other programming tutorials this series of
articles will explain not only how to do fast graphics but <i>how </i>fast
graphics work. You will first learn about pure VB routines for graphics
processing; next comes the basic API routines of GetPixel and
SetPixel/V; third comes the more advanced GetBitmapBits, SetBitmapBits,
and DIB sections; the last tutorial will cover additional optimizations
for the real speed demons out there. By the end of this series of
tutorials you will be able to effectively write any graphics
application you can dream up using nothing but Visual Basic and the
Windows API.</font></p>


      
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But before we jump into the code, it's probably good to clarify a little bit about graphics programming in general.</font></p>

      
      
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="font-weight: bold;">General Graphics Programming Stuff</span></font></p>

      
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Graphics programming (hereafter
referred to as GP) is, in my opinion, the most far-reaching aspect of
programming. Every Windows, Linux, and Mac program that has been
written in the last fifteen years has utilized graphics in some way.
Because of the popularity of GUI-based operating systems, every
programmer has been forced to learn at least the fundamentals of GP, -
because any program they write must include little picture boxes,
have nice&nbsp;buttons and toolbars, load with a pretty splash screen,
etc
etc. </font></p>


      
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now it's true that some programs don't use many graphics routines - but every program you own uses <i>some</i>
graphics. &nbsp;Next time you turn on your computer, start thinking about all
of the GP involved in simple, everyday routines - clicking on your start
bar, the animated folder that appears when you copy a file, that
progress bar at the bottom of a program's window. You'll quickly be amazed at
how many GP techniques are utilized within every program you run.</font></p>


      
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As you can imagine, a lot could
be said about graphics programming. &nbsp;I do not intend to talk about
EVERYTHING graphics related, so here's the part of GP that this set of
tutorials will
cover: <span style="font-weight: bold;">per-pixel image interface routines.</span> &nbsp;Basically, we're going to
discuss how to get a picture's pixel information, how to transfer it
into a data structure we can use (arrays), and how to put those pixels back onto
the screen once we're done with them. We'll go from the easiest and
slowest ways to the fastest and most advanced ways available to you,
the common Visual Basic programmer.</font></p>


      
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What this tutorial will <i>not</i>
cover is how to do specific image editing routines (please refer to the
numerous source code examples on the internet for that), how to write
graphics-based dlls or ocxs, or how to use DirectX. There are resources
for each of these if you are interested; my goal is simply to outline
the standard Windows API methods for per-pixel image interfacing.</font></p>


      
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Are you excited? &nbsp;You should be! &nbsp;On to the tutorials!&nbsp;</font></p>
